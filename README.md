# \[SBE201\] Final Project Proposals

Groups that didn't yet decide an idea for their final project are suggested one of the ideas in this file.

## P1. Patterns Matching

Make a survey over these algorithms (at least two algorithms) and compare their time and space complexity:

* Trie,
* Suffix Tree,
* Suffix Array,
* and Burrows-Wheeler-Transform (BWT)

Implement either a **trie** or burrows wheeler transform.

### Data and Testing

Use [rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info) platform to test your algorithms.

1. [TrieMatching](http://rosalind.info/problems/ba9b/)
1. [Pattern Matching with the Suffix Array](http://rosalind.info/problems/ba9h/)
1. [BWMatching](http://rosalind.info/problems/ba9l/)

* [Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees](http://marknelson.us/1996/08/01/suffix-trees/)


## P2. Huffman Compression Algorithm

In this project, you are required to implement a Huffman compression algorithm. You need to compile to programs: one for compressing an input file, and another one to decompress an input compressed file.

What you will learn:

* Gain more intuition on how compression programs work.
* Huffman as a binary tree data structure.
* Use priority queue in constructing the huffman tree.
* Greedy algorithms.
* Probability and Entropy.
* Reading and writing to files in C++.
